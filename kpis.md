## What KPIs can be used for a Software Product Startup? ##
A software product startup can use a variety of key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure its success and progress. Here are some KPIs that are commonly used by software product startups:

1. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: This KPI measures the monthly revenue generated by the startup from its subscription-based products or services.
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: This KPI measures the cost of acquiring a new customer. This includes marketing and sales expenses, as well as the cost of onboarding the customer.
3. **Churn Rate**: This KPI measures the rate at which customers are leaving the startup's product or service. This can be expressed as a percentage of the total customer base.
4. **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: This KPI measures the total value of a customer over the entire duration of their relationship with the startup. This includes both the revenue generated by the customer and the cost of serving them.
5. **Monthly Active Users (MAU)**: This KPI measures the number of unique users who engage with the startup's product or service in a given month.
6. **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: This KPI measures the average amount of revenue generated by each user of the startup's product or service.
7. **Conversion Rate**: This KPI measures the rate at which potential customers are converting into paying customers. This can be measured at various points in the customer journey, such as from website visitor to trial user, or from trial user to paying customer.
8. **Gross Margins**: This KPI measures the difference between the revenue generated by the startup and the cost of delivering its product or service.

These are just a few examples of KPIs that a software product startup can use to measure its success and progress. The specific KPIs that are most relevant will depend on the startup's business model, target market, and goals.
