# The Lean Approach #
## The Lean Approach: Introduction ##
1. How are startups different from large companies
2. Lean startup
	1. Customer development process
	2. MVP
	3. How to build prototypes
	4. Customer acquisition

## The Lean Approach: The Lean Method ##
1. Thee components of lean method:
	1. Business Model Design
	2. Customer Development
	3. Agile Engineering
2. Advantages of focusing on the above components:
	1. Efficient
		1. Reduces time to get first product
		2. Reduces cash required
3. **We learn from customers and discover outside the office**
	1. There are no facts inside your building - Get outside
		1. We are not smarter than collective intelligence of customers
	2. Test key features as quickly as we can
		1. Initial hypothesis
			1. Write down all the hypothesis
				1. Use **Alexander Osterwaler's business model canvas**
					1. Framework & scorecard
					2. Test them with formal process called customer development
						1. Design the experiment
						2. Run the experiment outside the building
						3. Get the data
						4. Look for insights
							1. Gathering insights:
								1. Show customers:
									1. Powerpoints
									2. Wireframes
									3. Clay models
									4. Protoypes
									5. ...
							2. **Gather as much info as we can from their feedback**
						5. If we get the hypothesis wrong, we change it (called pivots)
							1. Pivot: A substantive change to one or more of the business model canvas components
							2. Iteration: A minor change
		2. **No plan survices first contact with customers**
			1. Each increment, we can learn and discover if we are on the right track
				1. Right track: 
					1. Do we have the right customers for the right features (product-market fit)
					2. Do we have the right distribution channel?
					3. Do we have the right revenue model?
					4. Do we have the right pricing?
					5. Do we have the right partners?
					6. Do we understand our costs?
				2. Lean Startup Model: We have a **process to test the above incrementally and cheaply**

## The Lean Approach: Getting Out of the Building: Customer Development ##
1. Customer Development: A formal process of testing hypothesis
	1. The hypothesis we believe don't tend to be right
	2. It is done outside the building
		1. In front of the customers, partners, other stakeholders
	3. Once we get a feedback, what type of small changes (iterations) or large changes (pivots) that we need to make?
2. How do we start the customer development process?
	1. Customer discovery helps to answer:
		1. Who is the customer?
		2. What is the problem?
		3. What are the potential solutions?
	2. We are also doing the above for potential partners, pricing, ...
	3. A series of conversations get formalized as a series of experiments:
		1. Did I acquire the number of customers I expected?
		2. Did I activate the number I expected?
		3. Did they use the product?
		4. Did they ask for demo?
		5. (Did something happen I expected to happen)
	4. **It is about asking a series of questions and designing experiments**
3. First person outside the building? Founder
	1. Don't use proxy
	2. **Ask a series of questions that helps us iterate on the spot**
	3. **Founders Job** (learning and discovering)
		1. **Get outside the building**
		2. **Lead the customer development team**
		3. **Be the authority**
		4. **Construct iterations and pivots**

## The Lean Approach: Customer Development Data ##
1. If I have a hypothesis, design experiments to test the hypothesis
2. **Customer development without collecting data is a sin**
	1. Hypothesis + experiment + data = insight
		1. We need to be entrepreneurial scientists (looking for insights in data)

## The Lean Approach: Minimum Viable Products ##
1. MVP
	1. Testing pieces of the product incrementally and iteratively
		1. What do I test?
		2. Why do I test it?
		3. How do we know what time to test it?
	2. General questions to answer:
		1. Is the problem (I think customers have or need they have) is shared by anybody other than me?
			1. How to find out?
				1. Example: A website that asks: "Do you have this problem? Click here"
				2. Example: One on one interview to find out if there people who share the problem
		2. Does the class of solutions (not the specific product but the product in general) solve the problem?
			1. Example: If there is website that did x, would that be interesting to you?
			2. Example: What if there is a physcial solution that tests x or y?
				1. Mockups
				2. Wireframes
				3. Clay prototypes
				4. ...
	3. It doesn't have to be bug-free and complete
		1. You are not building a product... you're getting customer feedback
			1. **Try to avoid engineering as much as possible until customer says, we need this and you just finish it and we will pay for it!**
	4. Use the MVPs to run experiments:
		1. A MVP is used to test a series of hypothesis
		2. We need to elicit what we expect to happen with the experiment
			1. **First guestimate what is expected to happen before conducting the experiment**
				1. Example: I expect 45% to give me a check. After testing, we figured out no one liked it (saves development time)
					1. Use the data to modify the hypothesis
	5. MVPs may usually not have any connection with the finished product
		1. Maximize learning without spending wasteful effort on engineering

## The Lean Approach: Customer Acquisition and Archetypes ##
1. Customer acquisition and archetypes
	1. How to get customers to website, physical store, retail location, ...?
		1. Customer acquisition: (front-end of getting customers)
			1. Lifecycle of the customer
				1. Get customers (customer acquisition)
				2. Keep customers
				3. Grow customers
			2. How to get customers?
				1. Creation of demand
					1. So that they can come to store
					2. How?
						1. With paid media
							1. Google ad-words
							2. Facebook ads
							3. Tumblr
							4. ...
						2. With free media
							1. Get stories across
							2. Give key-notes at conferences
							3. ...
					3. We want people to go to where we are (acquisition)
			3. Next step:
				1. Activation
					1. Got them to type their email
					2. Got them to use the product
					3. Got them to download a demo
					4. Buy product on website
					5. ...
2. Customer Archetypes: Getting to know your customers
	1. We need to know a lot about potential customers
		1. Know everything about a customer
			1. To know the most effective place I need demand to be created in
			2. It drives customer acquisition
	2. How to figure it out?
		1. **Understand day in the life of a customer**
			1. What do they do the minute they getup until they go to bed?
			2. Where are they living?
			3. When and where are they driving?
			4. What do they read in the morning? Blogs, newspapers, ...
			5. When they get to work, what is on their computer?
			6. What kind of apps or computer are they using?
			7. What are they buying?
			8. ...
		2. These might be useful to target them outside the office, at homes, ...
3. Matching archetypes to acquisition
	1. At the beginning, customer archetype is a hypothesis:
		1. We need to tie customer hypothesis of archetype to customer hypothesis for acquisition programs
			1. How?
				1. Run experiments
					1. Try acquisition programs with key-words targeting the customer archetype or ads in areas we expect them to be in
						1. We can then check if they are our customers
						2. Acquire and check if they will activate
					2. These experiments are for customer discovery and customer development
						1. We might find out that they are not doing what we expect them to do (keep the experiments cheap and fast so that we don't go out of business)
							1. If it passed, we put more money and continue
							2. If it failed, find out why and try something else
4. Growing customers: The lifetime value
	1. Keeping and growing customers are of equal interest in a startup
		1. Once we get customers, it is cheaper to make them buy even more
		2. Ensure that they do not go away
			1. Do programs that grow them and try to get additional revenue
				1. Royalty programs
				2. Newsletters
				3. Great customer support
				4. ...
		3. Initial sale is not the total sale we make to a customer
			1. Think about lifetime value of a customer
				1. How to cross-sell, next-sell, upsell?
					1. **Learn the techniques**
		4. Understand how much it costs at the front-end (customer acquisition)
			1. Compare it with the lifetime value of a customer
				1. What can we sell over the lifetime of a customer continually? (spread over lifetime value)
5. The biggest mistake in customer acquisition
	1. To believe that we have got it and let us spend the money
		1. Just because we have it, it doesn't mean we spend it
		2. Solution: **Find something repeatable and then pour the money into it**
	2. If we really don't understand our archetype, we are only guessing and they are expensive guesses
		1. The experiments must convince ourself that this is the right archetype (derived from data acquired)
	3. We don't need ad agency at the beginning
		1. The learning must be done by the team and not by third party
