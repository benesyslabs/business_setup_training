			2. Here are the key characteristics and elements of crowdfunding:
				1. **Online Platforms**: **Crowdfunding campaigns are typically conducted through dedicated online platforms**, such as **Kickstarter**, **Indiegogo**, **GoFundMe**, or **Patreon**. These platforms provide a **space for innovators, entrepreneurs, or individuals to showcase their projects and solicit contributions**.
				2. **Project-Based Funding**: **Crowdfunding is often used to support specific projects or initiatives, including business startups, creative endeavors, product development, charitable causes, community projects, and more**. The projects can vary widely, ranging from tech gadgets and films to medical expenses and disaster relief efforts.
				3. **Small Contributions**: **Crowdfunding campaigns typically rely on small contributions from a large number of people, known as backers or supporters**. **Contributors can choose to donate varying amounts of money based on their interest in the project and the available reward options**.
				4. **Rewards or Incentives**: **Crowdfunding campaigns often offer rewards or incentives to backers as a way to encourage contributions**. These **rewards can be tiered based on the amount donated and may include perks such as early access to products, exclusive content, personalized items, or recognition**.
				5. **All-or-Nothing or Keep-It-All**: Depending on the platform and campaign, there are different funding models. **Some platforms employ an "all-or-nothing" model where the project must reach its predetermined funding goal within a specified time frame; otherwise, all the pledged funds are returned to the backers**. **Other platforms follow a "keep-it-all" model, where the project receives all the funds raised, regardless of whether the target goal is reached**.
